# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical technology stack and architectural improvements for the Relationship Care Platform based on production readiness concerns, performance requirements, and enterprise compliance needs. The current implementation has several architectural decisions that need reconsideration for production deployment, particularly around AI model selection, performance expectations, CRM integration complexity, and microservices architecture.
