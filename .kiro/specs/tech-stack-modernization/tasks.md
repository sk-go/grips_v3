# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a realistic, validation-first approach. Instead of building complex infrastructure upfront, we start with a minimal viable system to prove value with 5-10 agents, then scale based on actual usage data and feedback.

## Phased Approach

### Phase 0: Validation (2-3 months) - Prove Core Value
- ONE CRM (Professional Works) with basic integration
- ONE AI model (Claude Sonnet) for all requests
- Web app only (no mobile)
- Manual handoffs (no automation)
- Basic communication aggregation
- **Goal**: Prove 5-10 agents find this useful

### Phase 1: Foundation (3-4 months) - Scale to 25 Agents
- Add proper CRM rate limiting and error handling
- Implement cost tracking and basic budgets
- Build mobile responsive design (PWA)
- Add simple AI routing based on actual usage patterns
- **Goal**: 25 agents using daily with proven productivity gains

### Phase 2: Scale (4-6 months) - Production Ready
- Add second CRM based on customer demand
- Implement team collaboration features
- Build native mobile app (if PWA proves insufficient)
- Add advanced AI features based on usage data
- **Goal**: 100+ agents with proven ROI
