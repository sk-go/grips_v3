# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently supports direct login functionality but lacks a user registration system. Insurance agents and administrators need the ability to create new accounts directly within the application using Supabase as the database backend. This registration system should integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication infrastructure while maintaining security best practices and compliance requirements for the insurance industry.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new insurance agent, I want to register for an account using my email and password, so that I can access the relationship care platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with email, password, first name, last name, and role fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new user account in the Supabase database
3. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL validate email format, password strength, and required field completion
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL send an email verification link to the user's email address
5. WHEN a user tries to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want new user registrations to require email verification, so that only valid email addresses can access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes registration THEN the system SHALL set their email_verified status to false
2. WHEN an email verification link is sent THEN the system SHALL generate a secure, time-limited verification token
3. WHEN a user clicks a valid verification link THEN the system SHALL mark their email as verified and activate their account
4. WHEN a user attempts to login with an unverified email THEN the system SHALL prevent login and prompt for email verification
5. WHEN a verification link expires or is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and offer to resend verification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control user roles during registration, so that appropriate access levels are assigned to different types of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL default their role to 'agent' unless specified otherwise
2. WHEN an administrator creates accounts THEN the system SHALL allow selection of 'agent' or 'admin' roles
3. WHEN role-based registration is implemented THEN the system SHALL validate that only authorized users can create admin accounts
4. WHEN a user's role is assigned THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches the allowed values ('agent', 'admin')

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want user passwords to meet strong security requirements, so that accounts are protected against unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL require minimum 8 characters with at least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
2. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds (minimum 12)
3. WHEN registration occurs THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent automated account creation
4. WHEN suspicious registration activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement CAPTCHA or similar verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback during the registration process, so that I understand what information is required and any errors that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with registration form fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
3. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with next steps
4. WHEN the registration process fails THEN the system SHALL preserve valid form data and highlight only the problematic fields

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want user registration to maintain audit trails, so that account creation can be tracked for regulatory purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL log the registration attempt with timestamp, IP address, and user agent
2. WHEN email verification occurs THEN the system SHALL log the verification event and timestamp
3. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and attempt details
4. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they cannot be modified and include correlation IDs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user registrations, so that I can approve, reject, or modify new accounts as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new users register THEN the system SHALL optionally support admin approval workflows
2. WHEN admin approval is required THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of pending registrations
3. WHEN administrators review registrations THEN the system SHALL provide user details and registration context
4. WHEN registration decisions are made THEN the system SHALL notify users of approval or rejection with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the registration system to integrate seamlessly with existing authentication infrastructure, so that login and session management work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users complete registration and verification THEN they SHALL be able to login using the existing direct login system
2. WHEN registration creates user records THEN they SHALL be compatible with existing user table schema and constraints
3. WHEN JWT tokens are generated for new users THEN they SHALL include the same claims as existing authentication
4. WHEN registration integrates with Supabase THEN it SHALL use the existing database service and connection patterns
