# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current authentication system redirects users to an external Keycloak login page, which creates a poor user experience and connection issues. Users should be able to login directly on the application's login page without being redirected to external services. This feature will implement a direct login form that authenticates users locally while maintaining security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an insurance agent, I want to login directly on the application's login page, so that I can access the system quickly without external redirects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them without redirecting to external services
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect users to their intended destination or dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user credentials to be stored securely in the local database, so that authentication can happen without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
2. WHEN user accounts are created THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength
3. WHEN users attempt login THEN the system SHALL compare hashed passwords securely
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form
2. WHEN a user enters their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link
3. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL allow them to set a new password
4. WHEN a reset link is used or expires THEN the system SHALL invalidate it for security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want JWT tokens to be generated and managed locally, so that session management is independent of external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT access token
2. WHEN JWT tokens are created THEN the system SHALL include user ID, email, and role claims
3. WHEN JWT tokens expire THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh token mechanism
4. WHEN users logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate their tokens appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to be backwards compatible, so that existing user data and integrations continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing user records SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN users have existing sessions THEN they SHALL be gracefully migrated or prompted to re-login
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL continue to work with the new authentication system
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically migrate from Keycloak user data if present
