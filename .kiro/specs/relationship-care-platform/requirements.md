# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Relationship Care Platform is a customer-focused overlay system for insurance agents to streamline client interactions while preserving the human element. AI exists solely to automate admin tasks, freeing agents for relationship-building. Core pillars: unified comms center, AI interaction system (enhanced with agentic capabilities for multi-step workflows), relationship enhancement layer (overlay on existing CRMs like Zoho, Salesforce, HubSpot, AgencyBloc). Keep minimal—avoid bloat or data duplication; sync only essential relationship data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Communication Center

**User Story:** As an agent, I want a centralized mailbox aggregating client comms from multiple channels, so I never miss interactions and can respond promptly to strengthen relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured with multiple email accounts THEN system SHALL aggregate via IMAP/SMTP delta sync into unified inbox, supporting Gmail/Outlook/Exchange
2. WHEN new email arrives THEN system SHALL ingest and display in <30s, with push notifications
3. WHEN client calls/texts non-office hours THEN Twilio SHALL capture, transcribe (accuracy >95%), and queue in center with timestamps
4. WHEN viewing center THEN agent SHALL access searchable timeline (full-text search, filters: date/sender/type), paginated for >1k items
5. WHEN displaying interactions THEN system SHALL auto-tag (e.g., urgent: keywords like "emergency"; client-specific: match CRM; follow-up: regex for "next steps")—configurable tags
6. WHEN errors occur (e.g., sync failure) THEN system SHALL log and alert agent via UI banner

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered System Interaction Center

**User Story:** As an agent, I want a real-time AI assistant with full context of clients/tasks/comms (from overlay/CRM), so I can voice-handle admin quickly and focus on relationships. Integrate agentic AI for autonomous multi-step workflows (e.g., via LangGraph) to chain actions like data pull, analysis, doc gen, and CRM updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN activated (hotkey/voice) THEN fluid circle UI SHALL pop up, using WebSocket for real-time speech (browser SpeechRecognition + fallback AssemblyAI)
2. WHEN agent speaks THEN system SHALL process with <1.5s latency (end-to-end), handling interruptions
3. WHEN task requested THEN AI SHALL extract actions via NLP (e.g., LangChain/LangGraph: parse "handle renewal for X" → chain: fetch CRM data, generate doc, draft email, seek approval)
4. WHEN processing THEN AI SHALL pull context from CRM/comms/tasks in-memory (Redis cache for speed); agentic flows SHALL decompose complex requests into sub-tasks
5. WHEN low-risk (e.g., note update) THEN AI SHALL execute auto, sync to CRM; high-risk (e.g., email send) THEN queue for verbal/UI approval; agentic chains SHALL pause at high-risk steps
6. WHEN drafting THEN AI SHALL mimic agent's style (train on past emails, default professional/empathetic tone)
7. WHEN action complete THEN AI SHALL confirm verbally + log in audit trail, update CRM; for chains, provide step-by-step summaries
8. WHEN voice fails (noise) THEN fallback to text input; support multi-lingual (e.g., English/Spanish via model switch)
9. WHEN agentic flow fails (e.g., low confidence <0.8) THEN escalate to agent with partial results; support rollback for chained actions

### Requirement 3: Relationship Enhancement Layer

**User Story:** As an agent using an existing CRM, I want an overlay that enhances client profiles with personal details and convo history, so I can recall info easily and make clients feel valued without duplicating data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing profile THEN system SHALL fetch/display from CRM: photo, hobbies/relations (graph viz: nodes/edges for family), key details (editable via CRM push)
2. WHEN pre-meeting THEN generate brief (AI-summarized: "Recall: Hobby Y; suggest Z follow-up")—customizable templates, pulling CRM data; agentic AI MAY chain to suggest actions like outreach
3. WHEN interaction ends THEN AI SHALL auto-update summaries (sentiment via NLP, e.g., VADER >0.5 positive), push to CRM notes
4. WHEN viewing history THEN show sentiment trends (line chart) and health score (0-100: freq + positivity), overlaid on CRM timeline
5. WHEN managing THEN highlight ops (e.g., "Birthday soon—suggest congrats email") based on CRM interests/calendar; agentic AI MAY automate low-risk follow-ups
6. WHEN accessing data THEN organize by relationship tabs (personal/transactional), searchable via CRM API
7. WHEN connections exist THEN render graph (D3.js), clickable for linked CRM profiles
8. WHEN data stale (>6mo no interaction, per CRM) THEN flag for outreach prompt; agentic AI MAY initiate chain for re-engagement

### Requirement 4: Privacy and Compliance

**User Story:** As an agent with sensitive data in CRM, I want robust privacy/compliance in the overlay, so data is secure and regs met without workflow disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing (cache only) THEN encrypt (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit); key rotation quarterly; no persistent non-CRM data
2. WHEN AI acts THEN log all (who/what/when) in immutable audit (e.g., blockchain-lite or DB triggers), sync to CRM logs if possible; include full agentic chain traces
3. WHEN sensitive detected (keywords: SSN/health) THEN flag, restrict access, notify agent—defer to CRM policies; halt agentic flows immediately
4. WHEN accessing THEN RBAC (agent-only; admin for audits); MFA required; inherit CRM auth where feasible
5. WHEN processing THEN comply HIPAA/GDPR (consent logs from CRM, data minimization); annual audit hooks
6. WHEN deciding THEN high-risk AI actions SHALL always human-confirm; error rate <1%; agentic chains SHALL classify each step's risk
7. WHEN breach suspected THEN auto-lockdown and alert (email/SMS to agent/admin)

### Requirement 5: System Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As an agent with existing CRM/tools, I want seamless integration, keeping overlay simple, so adoption is easy without workflow breaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email integrating THEN support IMAP/SMTP; OAuth for secure auth
2. WHEN phone handling THEN Twilio webhooks for routing/transcription; configurable office hours
3. WHEN extending THEN modular APIs (REST/GraphQL); core boundaries via service mesh (e.g., Istio); support agentic extensions via plugins
4. WHEN adding features THEN require approval gates to enforce minimalism (e.g., <5% code growth per release)
5. WHEN deployed THEN web app (React, mobile-responsive); offline caching for comms/CRM pulls
6. WHEN using THEN multi-lang/dialect support (AI models: Whisper for speech)
7. WHEN voice unavailable THEN text fallback; accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
8. WHEN onboarding THEN guided setup wizard (email/Twilio/CRM config in <10min)
9. WHEN integrating CRM THEN support APIs for top systems (Zoho, Salesforce, HubSpot, AgencyBloc); bi-directional sync for relationship data
10. WHEN CRM unavailable THEN fallback to local cache with expiration; notify agent; limit agentic flows to cached data

### Requirement 6: Non-Functional Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable, performant overlay, so it supports daily use without frustration or CRM overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. System SHALL handle 100 concurrent agents, <500ms UI response (including CRM API calls and agentic chains).
2. Uptime >99.9%; auto-scale on cloud (AWS/GCP).
3. Backup daily (cache only); disaster recovery <1hr.
4. Unit/integration tests >80% coverage; security scans pre-release, including CRM mocks and agentic scenarios.
5. Usability: Intuitive UI (A/B test scores >8/10).

*Improvement:* Agentic may spike latency—optimize chains for parallelism; critical for prod.

### Requirement 7: Automated Document Generation

**User Story:** As an insurance agent, I want to automatically create documents via Jinja2 and WeasyPrint when needed, for example an advisory protocol, so I can generate compliant docs quickly without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI detects doc need (e.g., voice: "Generate advisory protocol for X") THEN system SHALL pull data from CRM/comms, render via Jinja2 template; agentic AI MAY chain with prior steps like data validation
2. WHEN rendering THEN system SHALL use WeasyPrint to convert HTML (from Jinja2) to PDF, supporting custom styles/fonts
3. WHEN generating THEN AI SHALL fill templates with context-aware data (e.g., client details, convo summaries), ensure compliance placeholders
4. WHEN high-risk (e.g., legal docs) THEN queue for agent preview/approval before finalizing/exporting
5. WHEN complete THEN system SHALL store PDF temporarily (cache), offer download/email, optional CRM upload
6. WHEN templates needed THEN system SHALL support user-uploaded Jinja2 templates, with defaults for common insurance docs
7. WHEN errors occur (e.g., missing data) THEN alert agent, suggest fixes; log for audits
