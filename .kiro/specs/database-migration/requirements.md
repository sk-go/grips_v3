# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables flexible database backend support for the Relationship Care Platform, allowing developers to use SQLite for local development while maintaining PostgreSQL compatibility for production deployment via Supabase. The migration addresses immediate development pain points while establishing a foundation for scalable database management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use SQLite for local development, so that I can avoid PostgreSQL configuration issues and get started quickly without authentication headaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in development mode THEN the system SHALL connect to a local SQLite database file
2. WHEN SQLite is used THEN the system SHALL automatically create the database file if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN using SQLite THEN all existing migrations SHALL run successfully without modification
4. IF SQLite is configured THEN the system SHALL NOT require any database server setup or password configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database layer to be abstracted, so that I can switch between SQLite and PostgreSQL without changing application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database service initializes THEN it SHALL detect the configured database type from environment variables
2. WHEN switching database types THEN the application code SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN using either database THEN all existing services SHALL work without modification
4. IF the database type is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily migrate to Supabase for production, so that I can deploy without managing PostgreSQL infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring for production THEN the system SHALL support Supabase connection strings
2. WHEN using Supabase THEN the system SHALL handle SSL connections and authentication automatically
3. WHEN migrating to production THEN existing SQLite data SHALL be exportable to PostgreSQL format
4. IF Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful debugging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing migrations to work with both databases, so that I don't need to maintain separate schema definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL execute all existing SQL migration files
2. WHEN using SQLite THEN PostgreSQL-specific syntax SHALL be automatically adapted where possible
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating compatibility issues
4. IF a migration is incompatible THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple environment configuration, so that I can switch database backends with minimal setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting NODE_ENV=development THEN the system SHALL default to SQLite
2. WHEN setting NODE_ENV=production THEN the system SHALL default to PostgreSQL/Supabase
3. WHEN DATABASE_TYPE is explicitly set THEN it SHALL override environment-based defaults
4. IF configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful setup instructions
