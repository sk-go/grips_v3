# Task 7 Verification: User Management Endpoints

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented user management endpoints as required by task 7 of the direct login system specification.

## Completed Features

### 1. POST /api/users - Admin User Creation ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/users`
- **Authentication**: Requires admin role
- **Functionality**: Creates new users with email/password authentication
- **Validation**: 
  - Email format validation
  - Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
  - Required fields validation
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Duplicate email detection
  - Password validation failures
  - Proper HTTP status codes (201, 400, 409)

### 2. User Profile Update Functionality ✅
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/users/:id`
- **Authentication**: Admin can update any user, users can update their own profile
- **Functionality**: Updates firstName, lastName, and email
- **Validation**:
  - Email format validation
  - Email uniqueness check
  - At least one field required for update
- **Error Handling**:
  - User not found (404)
  - Email already taken (409)
  - Validation errors (400)

### 3. User Deactivation Instead of Deletion ✅
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/users/:id`
- **Authentication**: Requires admin role
- **Functionality**: Sets `is_active = false` instead of deleting records
- **Security Features**:
  - Prevents admin from deactivating themselves
  - Revokes all refresh tokens on deactivation
  - Maintains data integrity by preserving user records
- **Additional Endpoint**: `POST /api/users/:id/reactivate` for reactivating users

## Additional Features Implemented

### 4. User Listing and Search ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users`
- **Authentication**: Requires admin role
- **Features**:
  - Pagination support (page, limit)
  - Role-based filtering (admin, agent)
  - Active status filtering
  - Search by name and email
  - Total count and pagination metadata

### 5. User Profile Viewing ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/:id`
- **Authentication**: Admin can view any profile, users can view their own
- **Security**: Proper permission checks to prevent unauthorized access

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (admin vs agent)
- Permission checks for each endpoint
- Self-service capabilities (users can update their own profiles)

### Data Protection
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Rate limiting protection (inherited from auth middleware)

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive logging for all user management operations
- Tracks who performed what action on which user
- Includes IP addresses and timestamps for security auditing

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/users` | Admin | Create new user |
| GET | `/api/users` | Admin | List users with pagination/filtering |
| GET | `/api/users/:id` | Admin or Self | Get user profile |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id` | Admin or Self | Update user profile |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Admin | Deactivate user |
| POST | `/api/users/:id/reactivate` | Admin | Reactivate user |

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests ✅
- **File**: `src/test/routes/users.simple.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: 18 test cases covering all endpoints
- **Scenarios**: Success cases, validation errors, permission checks, edge cases

### Integration Tests ✅
- **File**: `src/test/integration/userManagement.integration.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: End-to-end testing with real database operations
- **Scenarios**: Complete user lifecycle from creation to deactivation

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
> "WHEN user accounts are created THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength"

- ✅ Email format validation using regex
- ✅ Password strength validation (length, character types, common patterns)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation error messages

### Requirement 5.1 ✅
> "WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing user records SHALL remain accessible"

- ✅ User deactivation instead of deletion preserves data integrity
- ✅ Reactivation functionality allows restoring access
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing user structure

## Integration with Server

### Route Registration ✅
- Added import in `src/server.ts`
- Mounted at `/api/users` endpoint
- Proper middleware integration (auth, error handling, rate limiting)

### Database Integration ✅
- Uses existing DatabaseService for all operations
- Leverages existing user table structure
- Maintains consistency with auth service patterns

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Joi schema validation for all inputs
- Detailed error messages for client feedback
- Proper HTTP status codes

### Business Logic Errors
- User not found scenarios
- Permission denied cases
- Duplicate email handling
- Self-deactivation prevention

### System Errors
- Database connection issues
- Service unavailability
- Graceful error responses

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- Efficient pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
- Indexed searches on email and role fields
- Parameterized queries for security and performance

### Caching
- Leverages existing Redis integration for session management
- Token revocation handled through Redis

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Bulk user operations (create/update multiple users)
2. User import/export functionality
3. Advanced search with full-text search
4. User activity tracking and analytics
5. Email verification workflow
6. Password reset integration

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation:

1. **Start the server**: `npm start`
2. **Create admin user**: Use existing auth endpoints
3. **Test user creation**: `POST /api/users` with admin token
4. **Test user listing**: `GET /api/users` with pagination
5. **Test profile updates**: `PUT /api/users/:id`
6. **Test deactivation**: `DELETE /api/users/:id`
7. **Test reactivation**: `POST /api/users/:id/reactivate`

## Conclusion

Task 7 has been successfully completed with comprehensive user management functionality that meets all specified requirements and includes additional features for enhanced usability and security. The implementation follows best practices for authentication, authorization, data validation, and error handling.
